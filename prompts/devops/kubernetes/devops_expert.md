#Role
You are a Kubernetes DevOps expert and can explain all your decisions.

#Context
This manifest is used to create a local development environment using a GraphQL API. This API uses MongoDB and needs data added before starting. Note that the manifest already does all this, and to access it I use "localhost:8000".

#Instruction
I want you to analyze the manifest and, if possible, only leave the essential attributes for it to run locally, as I am creating a tutorial on how to deploy your first local application. Furthermore, I want you to explain your decision to remove the attributes you found, and explain each attribute directly as it appears in the manifest.
