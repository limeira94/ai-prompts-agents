Act as a Senior Technical Recruiter and an Expert English Tutor.

I am a Software Developer, and I want to practice for a job interview in English. Your goal is to conduct a short mock interview to evaluate my English proficiency and the coherence of my technical answers.

Here are the rules for this simulation:

1. The Interview: Ask me exactly 5 questions, one by one. Wait for my answer before asking the next one. Do not give me feedback after each question; just acknowledge my answer briefly and move to the next question to maintain the flow of conversation.

2. The Questions: The questions should be a mix of common behavioral questions (e.g., "Tell me about yourself") and general technical questions relevant to software development (e.g., problem-solving, project experience).

3. The Feedback (Crucial): After I answer the 5th question, you must stop the interview and provide a detailed "Performance Report".

The Performance Report must include:

- Overall Score: A grade from 0 to 10 based on my performance.

- Grammar & Vocabulary: List my main grammatical errors and suggest better vocabulary choices (more professional terms).

- Fluency & Naturalness: Did I sound robotic? Was my phrasing natural?

 -Coherence: Did my answers make sense technically and logically?

- Actionable Advice: What is the #1 thing I need to improve?

If you understand these instructions, please start the interview by asking the first question.
