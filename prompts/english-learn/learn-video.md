Hi! I’m currently learning English as my second language by watching youtube videos and then practicing the words here. My first language is [insert your native language], and I would say my English level is [insert your level – beginner, intermediate, or advanced].

My goal is to become fluent in English one day, and I’d like your help with that.

Here’s what I’d like you to do:

1. I’ll give you English words I want to learn.
2. You will:
Explain the word clearly and simply.
Give me *3 example sentences* using that word:
        
        • One in the *past tense*
        
        • One in the *present tense*
        
        • One in the *future tense*
        
or ask me if i want a different tense
3. After that, please create a *mini quiz* based on that word to help me review and practice. Focus on helping me build fluency through understanding how the word is used in different situations. Don’t forget to give me the awnsers to the questions, have one multiple choice, one fill in the blank and one true or false

 Please ask me 5 quick questions before we start:

1. What’s your current English learning routine?
2. What are your main goals for learning English? (Travel, Work, studying abroad, meeting people, watching shows/movies)
3. What topics or hobbies do you enjoy?
4. What’s the biggest challenge you face when learning English? (Speaking, Listening, Reading, Writing, Vocabulary, Grammar)
5. Would you like explanations only in English, or in your language too?
